Non-Profit Organization: Sisi Lain Ibukota

About the organization

Mission:
Sisi Lain Ibukota is a non-profit organization dedicated to enriching the lives of underprivileged Indonesians. They accomplish this by distributing previously owned items, care packages, and spreading love and compassion within communities.

Vision:
Their vision seems focused on creating a community-driven movement where generosity and aid reach those who face the challenges of poverty directly. They envision a society where the basic needs of every individual are met through collective action and kindness.

What They Do:
SLIK provides care packages to those in need, which include essential food items such as rice, sugar, cereals, and biscuits, as shown in one of the posts.

Supporting Local Vendors: They support struggling local food businesses by purchasing their food and redistributing it to those in need, creating a sustainable model of aid that also bolsters the local economy.

Community Engagement: SLIK encourages community involvement and volunteerism, inviting the public to contribute through donations or direct participation in their outreach activities.

Donations of Goods: They accept and redistribute donated goods ranging from clothes to toys, thereby giving these items a second life while assisting those in need.
